# Huffman-encoding-enables-file-compression-and-decompression
Using Huffman Encoding to zip and unzip file in C

This is one of my Data Structure Home Work, I think that it is very funny to do this job so that I want to share some of my experiences in GitHub.

## There are some technical difficulties that I will explain hereï¼š

We know that all files that stored in our computer can be read in binary mode, so if we can creat a fuunction to deal with those binary codes, we can solve all problems.
